##Analytical Questions
1. Does fuel economy continue to increase year over year for all makes and models?
2. Does fuel economy increased until some common year (1996-98 catalytic converter?), and show signs of a plateau since?
3. Does fuel economy differ significantly by location?
a. globally, (cheap gas prices in some countries?)
b. within a country (hilly vs. flat areas)
4. Does real world mean fuel economy match 2-cycle test or 5-cycle test institutional data?

##Challenges
- Institutional data not always representative of real world use. (Veracity)
- Real world data full of errors, outliers, and missing data. (Veracity, Variety, ~Volume)
- Dimensionality, obtaining enough different make-models, for enough years, with large enough N, with enough fuel ups to provide significant sample.
- Still learning pandas and error-free web scrapping.
- Statistical analysis easy to make assumptions
